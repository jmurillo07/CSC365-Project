## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

This API is meant to serve an application extracting information on UFC fighter and event data. The UFC (ultimate fighting championship) is the premier mixed martial arts competition in the world that hosts events throughout the year on a near weekly basis. Additionally, it has support for users and community predictions, storing the predictions users have on certain fights on who would win.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Built With

 - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
 - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
 - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/lo/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

 - fastapi==0.88.0
 - pytest==7.1.3
 - uvicorn==0.20.0
 - sqlalchemy==2.0.7
 - psycopg2-binary~=2.9.3

### Installation

After cloning the repository, create a `.env` file where you will then fill out the below with your own values. This will allow the engine to connect to your database.
```
POSTGRES_DB="postgres"
POSTGRES_SERVER="localhost"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="postgres"
POSTGRES_USER="postgres"
POSTGRES_PORT="54322"
```

If desired, one can run `converter.py` to populate their database with real data (`ufc_event_data.csv`, `ufc_fighters.csv`) or `src/post_fake_data.py` to populate it with fake data.

## Usage

### Usage

We have a production API being hosted on Vercel here: 

 - [Production](https://csc-365-project-rosy.vercel.app/)

If you would like to create your own server, you would need to adjust your environment variables for your database appropriately.

Starting up a local server then becomes as easy as:
```sh
python main.py
```

## Roadmap

## Acknowledgements

Huge gratitude towards https://github.com/jackalnom/movie_api for providing us with a template we heavily relied on.

The `.csv` files were taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatismajli/ufc-data?select=ufc_event_data.csv.

Additionally, https://github.com/jackalnom/fake_post_data was referenced to aid in the creation of our fake data populator.
